# My Deal Icon Font
> Using icomoon for handling the creation and updating of and svg icon font

## Uploading

To use icomoon for editing or updating the font, go to [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/) and click the icon that looks like a stack of papers on the top bar towards the right

You may have to delete a project that is already there.  Once you have not active projects (the free tier only allows one project), click `Import Project` and upload `MyDealFont.json` included in the repo.

## Editing a Font

Once you have the json file uploaded, click `Load` at the end of the name of the font project to go into edit mode.

You should now see a screen showing the svg icons that have been uploaded into this font.

> You can drag/drop new `svg`'s into this font or click the trashcan to delete existing ones.

## Creating the Font

Once you are done editing, click `Generate Font` at the bottom of the screen.  This will show you all the icons as they will be rendered in the font.

> Make sure you look through the images, some `svg`'s do not translate into fonts well

You can edit the names of these icons by clicking on them

> This is important!  This will affect what CSS class you apply to show the icon.

When done, click `Download` and import the fonts/css into your project!
